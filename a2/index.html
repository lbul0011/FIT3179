                    <p>The Victorian train network is incredibly expansive. Combined, there are a total of 222 passenger 
                train stations in Victoria. Here you can see the busiest and least busiest stations in the network. It's clear that suburban train stations are 
                extensively used by Melbournians. By passenger count, the CBD stations are the busiest - reflecting the concentrated workforce in the city and 
                the limited alternative transit options. <br><br> As urban sprawl continues across Melbourne, there is a shifting
                trend in the demand placed on outer suburban stations. You can see this in the outer Western and Northern lines, in stations such
                as Werribee (1,049,600), Watergardens (1,295,450) and Craigieburne (1,508,250). These stations are responsible for serving
                some of the fastest growing pockets of Melbourne, and reflect the increasing pressures placed on the public train system.</p>

            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <div class = "vis-2-container"><p>The Victorian train schedule can be broadly categorised into the following groups: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre AM: 12:00am - 6:59am</li>
                        <li>AM Peak: 7:00am - 9:29am</li>
                        <li>Interpeak: 9:30am - 2:59pm</li>
                        <li>PM Peak: 3:00pm - 6:59pm</li>
                        <li>PM Late: 7:00pm - 11:59pm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In general, the busiest times for the train system are during the AM peak. This reflects the high demand for the system 
                        both by students and those commuting to work. There is also considerable demand on the system in the PM peak and interpeak periods. 
                        Interestingly, during 2020 (when Victoria was largely shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic) the highest peak periods shifted
                        from the AM peak to the PM peak. Use the year dropdown to explore further trends in patronage from 2018-2022.
